Their simple task turned into a year-long journey across America, forming a close bond. In Salt Lake City, Joel learned Ellie had to die for a cure, so he killed the head surgeon and fled with Ellie to Jackson. For years, Ellie resented Joel for saving her. In 2038, Abby Anderson, the surgeon's daughter, killed Joel, leading Ellie to pursue Abby for revenge. Failing, Ellie retired to a farm with Dina and son JJ, but later abandoned them to hunt Abby again, ultimately sparing her.
