    bio: "Ellie grew up as an orphan in Boston's quarantine zone and attended a FEDRA military school. At fourteen, she discovered she was immune to the Cordyceps infection. Marlene, leader of the Fireflies, believed Ellie was key to a vaccine and asked smuggler Joel Miller to escort her out of the QZ. Their simple task turned into a year-long journey across America, forming a close bond. In Salt Lake City, Joel learned Ellie had to die for a cure, so he killed the head surgeon and fled with Ellie to Jackson. For years, Ellie resented Joel for saving her. In 2038, Abby Anderson, the surgeon's daughter, killed Joel, leading Ellie to pursue Abby for revenge. Failing, Ellie retired to a farm with Dina and son JJ, but later abandoned them to hunt Abby again, ultimately sparing her. Ellie returned to the farm, accepting Joel's death and his choice to save her."
